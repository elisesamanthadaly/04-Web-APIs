# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

This application is a multiple choice quiz! The quiz is timed, and the user loses time if they choose incorrect answers. At the end of the quiz, users can store their initials and score into local storage for future viewing.

The quiz can be found [here](https://elisesamanthadaly.github.io/2-22-21-Homework/).


## Usage

Click the "Start Quiz" button to begin.

The timer can be seen during the quiz in the upper righthand corner. Users begin with 75 seconds to complete the quiz.

For each of the five questions, click one of the answer choice (a - d) buttons to proceed.

An alert flashes in the center of the screen after each question, displaying whether the selected answer choice was correct or incorrect.

Selecting incorrect answers incurs a time penalty of 15 seconds.

When the user finishes the quiz (or if the timer runs out before the quiz is finished), previous highscores are displayed. The user also can input their initials to store their current score, or clear previous highscores.

Click the "Go Back" button to start the quiz over.

At any time during the quiz, the "View Highscores" button in the upper lefthand corner can be clicked to display previous highscores. This stops any currently running quiz.
